# On the "Token lensbeats.lens-Follower" topic.

### Hello Lens Frens ðŸŒ¿
As you may or may not seen, we have experienced what seems like the first rug pull on [lens](https://lens.xyz).
There has been **15.034 wallets** that has followed **lensbeats.lens** over a quite short span of time, due to their promised incentives and future utility of the [$BEATS](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xc434a867aa0f88aef9422526996ee71bca263dd6) airdrop.

There has been approximately **3.6k MATIC** to which many of us including me have contributed to. 
Since all of this data is on-chain we can keep track of the funds and watch the next moves of the actor. Only until...

For anyone interested the address of the **attacker** is: [0xB430049F8dF3d3883Df96F784dEE5C0f5596c45B](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xb430049f8df3d3883df96f784dee5c0f5596c45b)

*UPDATE: Since then, the funds has been moved to a [new wallet](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x3c3c7392cdd2903e1eaef1cc18b9f7e778f78fd5) followed by a transfer to what seems like an [exchange account](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x576b81f0c21edbc920ad63feeeb2b0736b018a58).

### Let's keep [this](https://lenster.xyz/posts/0x18ab-0x6c) in mind

### What is the plan?
Let's raise funds together and renumerate all the addresses that were effected by the unfortunate use of our growing decentralized social graph. I have created a list of all holders of the **"lensbeats.lens-F"** and I aim to raise funds, through collect module enabled post on Lens Protocol **(1 Collect = 1 MATIC)**. 

I have used [holders.at](https://holders.at/) to fetch all the holder addresses and you can verify the data here: https://holders.at/polygon/0x2d8ccea49fb2b88c45c8a8312f8f639b167713a0/34550100

All **the funds** that we will crowdfund together will be then **split and dispersed equally** to the affected wallets (using [Disperse](https://disperse.app/)). In case we raise more funds then the net worth of the scam, I suggest to donate the money to a project that wants to take music seriously and build on what lensbeats started but never finished.

Let's spread the knowledge and awareness of such "rugs", and let's show that together we can coordinate and contribute towards the proactive instead of destructive environment and community building on Lens Protocol!

### What can we do next?
It seems like reputation is the topic to address.

What tools can we build to assign profiles with a certain score and what would be the metrics of how to get reputation?

Reputation scoring systems has been providing us with the ability to recognize trustworthiness of other users before interacting with them. It helps us to reduce the chances of fraud and scams. 

How do we do this without infringing on the privacy of users? Is it just a feedback loop? Traditional eShop customer user reviews that helps us distinguish the actors? The ones we see always flooded with bots? Surely there is a different path! 

Is it a machine learning algorithm, where the computer system is trained to identify patterns in user behaviour? Could this be certain on-chain action? Are we going to prove credibility based on followers and their individual score?

How many degrees of separation do we need to assess the trustworthiness of an individual? Now we have some tools to not only keep track but to co-own our connections and share the relations! Let's explore.
