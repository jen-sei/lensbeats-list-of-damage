# On the "Token lensbeats.lens-Follower" topic.

### Hello Lens Frens ðŸŒ¿
As you may or may not seen, we have experienced what seems like the first rug pull on lens.
There has been **15034 wallets** that has followed **lensbeats.lens** over a quite short span of time, due to their promised incetives and future utility.

There has been approximately **3.6k MATIC** to which many of us including me have contributed to. 
Since all of this data is onchain we can keep track of the funds and watch the next moves of the actor.

For anyone interested the address of the attacker is: **0xB430049F8dF3d3883Df96F784dEE5C0f5596c45B**

You can easily follow the moves on: https://polygonscan.com/address/0xb430049f8df3d3883df96f784dee5c0f5596c45b

Let's raise funds together and renumerate all the addresses that were effected by the unfortunate use of our growing decentralized social graph.

I have created a list of all holders of the **"lensbeats.lens-F"** and I aim to raise funds, through collect module enabled post on Lens Protocol **(1 Collect = 1 MATIC)**.

All the funds that we will crowfund together will be then split and dispersed equally to the effected wallets. In case we raise more funds then the net worth of the scam,
I suggest to donate the money to a project that wants to take music seriously and build on what lensbeats started but never finished.

Let's spread the knowledge and awarness of such scams, and let's contribute towards the greater good together!
