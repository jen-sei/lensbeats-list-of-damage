# On the "Token lensbeats.lens-Follower" topic.

### Hello Lens Frens ðŸŒ¿
As you may or may not seen, we have experienced what seems like the first rug pull on [lens](https://lens.xyz).
There has been **15.034 wallets** that has followed **lensbeats.lens** over a quite short span of time, due to their promised incetives and future utility of the [$BEATS](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xc434a867aa0f88aef9422526996ee71bca263dd6) airdrop.

There has been approximately **3.6k MATIC** to which many of us including me have contributed to. 
Since all of this data is onchain we can keep track of the funds and watch the next moves of the actor.

For anyone interested the address of the **attacker** is: [0xB430049F8dF3d3883Df96F784dEE5C0f5596c45B](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xb430049f8df3d3883df96f784dee5c0f5596c45b)

Since then, the funds has been moved to a [new wallet](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x3c3c7392cdd2903e1eaef1cc18b9f7e778f78fd5) followed by a transfer to what seems like an [exchange account](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x576b81f0c21edbc920ad63feeeb2b0736b018a58).

Let's raise funds together and renumerate all the addresses that were effected by the unfortunate use of our growing decentralized social graph. I have created a list of all holders of the **"lensbeats.lens-F"** and I aim to raise funds, through collect module enabled post on Lens Protocol **(1 Collect = 1 MATIC)**. 

I have used [holders.at](https://holders.at/) to fetch all the holder addresses and you can verify the data here: https://holders.at/polygon/0x2d8ccea49fb2b88c45c8a8312f8f639b167713a0/34550100

All **the funds** that we will crowfund together will be then **split and dispersed equally** to the effected wallets (using [Disperse](https://disperse.app/)). In case we raise more funds then the net worth of the scam, I suggest to donate the money to a project that wants to take music seriously and build on what lensbeats started but never finished.

Let's spread the knowledge and awarness of such "rugs", and let's show that together we can coordinate and contribute towards the proactive instead of destructive enviroment and community building on Lens Protocol!
