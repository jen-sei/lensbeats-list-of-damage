# On the "Token lensbeats.lens-Follower" topic.

### Hello Lens Frens ðŸŒ¿
As you may or may not have seen, we have experienced what seems like the first rug pull on [lens](https://lens.xyz).
There have been **15.034 wallets** that have followed **lensbeats.lens** over quite a time, due to the promised incentives and future utility of the [$BEATS](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xc434a867aa0f88aef9422526996ee71bca263dd6) airdrop.

There has been approximately **3.6k MATIC** raised. Many of us, including me, have contributed to the pool. Since all this data is on-chain, we can keep track of the funds and watch the actor's next moves. Only until...

For anyone interested the address of the **attacker** is: [0xB430049F8dF3d3883Df96F784dEE5C0f5596c45B](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xb430049f8df3d3883df96f784dee5c0f5596c45b)

**UPDATE:** Since then, the funds have been moved to a [new wallet](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x3c3c7392cdd2903e1eaef1cc18b9f7e778f78fd5), followed by a transfer to what seems like an [exchange account](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x576b81f0c21edbc920ad63feeeb2b0736b018a58).

### Let's keep [this](https://lenster.xyz/posts/0x18ab-0x6c) in mind!

### What is the plan?
Let's raise funds together and remunerate all the addresses that were affected by the unfortunate use of our growing decentralized social graph. I have created a list of all holders of the **"lensbeats.lens-F"**. I aim to raise funds through the collect module enabled post on Lens Protocol **(1 Collect = 1 WMATIC, 2 WMATIC)**. 

I have used [holders.at](https://holders.at/) to fetch all the holder addresses, and you can verify the data here: https://holders.at/polygon/0x2d8ccea49fb2b88c45c8a8312f8f639b167713a0/34550100

All **the funds** that we will crowdfund together will then be **split and dispersed equally** to the affected wallets (using [Disperse](https://disperse.app/)). In case we raise more funds then the net worth of the scam, I suggest donating the money to a project that wants to take music seriously and build on what lensbeats started but never finished.

*EDIT: After [@punkess.lens](https://lenster.xyz/posts/0x0f85-0x0503) pointed out the discrepancies of equal distribution in first post, it makes sense to adjust the distribution strategy after we reach 150.34 $WMATIC collected (equal to 0.01 per wallet). We will look at the most affected wallets and derive from there.

Let's spread the knowledge and awareness of such "rugs", and let's show that together we can coordinate and contribute towards the proactive, instead of destructive environment and community building on Lens Protocol!

### What can we do next?
Reputation is the topic to address.

What tools can we build to assign profiles with a certain score and what would be the metrics of how to get reputation?

Reputation scoring systems has been providing us with the ability to recognize trustworthiness of other users before interacting with them. It helps us to reduce the chances of fraud and scams. 

How do we do this without infringing on the privacy of users? Is it just a feedback loop? Traditional eShop customer user reviews that helps us distinguish the actors? The ones we see always flooded with bots? Surely there is a different path! 

Is it a machine learning algorithm, where the computer system is trained to identify patterns in user behaviour? Is this a certain on-chain action? Are we going to prove credibility based on followers and their individual score? Will this score become a social collateral to lend against? What happens when you get liquidated? Are you willing to stake your relationships and network status to back up what you say or relate to? Should you?

How many degrees of separation do we need to assess the trustworthiness of an individual? Now we have some tools not only to keep track, but to co-own our connections and share the relations! Let's explore.
